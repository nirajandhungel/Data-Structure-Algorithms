# DSA Learning Series 🌳✨

Welcome to my **DSA Learning Series** repository!  
This repo contains a curated collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** implementations, explanations, example problems, and solutions.  
It’s designed to help me — and anyone interested — strengthen foundational programming concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

### Data Structures
- Arrays  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)  
- Graphs  
- Hash Tables  
- Heaps  
- Tries  
- And more...

### Algorithms
- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, Bubble Sort)  
- Searching (Binary Search)  
- Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS)  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Backtracking  
- Divide and Conquer  
- Advanced Topics (Segment Trees, etc.)

### Example Problems
Each topic includes solved example problems with clear explanations and well-commented code.

### Code
Clean, easy-to-read code implemented primarily in **JavaScript** and **C++**, with plans to expand into other languages.
